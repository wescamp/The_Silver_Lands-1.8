# Difficulty WML code selection macro DIFF, which I wrote to simplify reading my WML code
# when it requires difficulty-conditional statements

# No tab or space-based indentation on this file to avoid trouble when these macros are used
# in middle of a quoted string literal

# wmlindent: start ignoring
# wmlscope: start conditionals
