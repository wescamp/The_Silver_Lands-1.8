"Since Kaarakitros is the embodiment of earth itself, he is omnipotent with "

"wields a heavy club composed of highly compressed earth and other strong "
"minerals, thus making it a very deadly weapon. Ostensibly, if Kaarakitros "

"Life. Many underestimate Kaarakitros' abilities with earth and nature, this "

"the fire produced by his abilities since his elemental jurisdiction does not "

"stillborn baby, that person is often taken to the courtyard of the Earth "
"Palace where there is a shrine. The person is place in front of the shrine "
"and an offering is placed in the shrine, if the offering is accepted it "
"glows green and it disappears into thin air (then it becomes a part of "

"The term 'vampire' is a word in an ancient dialect of the human language "
"that would mean 'corrupted blood' in the modern tongue. In reality, vampires "
"are not of a totally different race, but are the result of when a living "
"creature's blood is corrupted by a very powerful, arcane type of magic. All "
"vampires have red glowing eyes, white hair, pale skin, long fangs, and a "
"craving for the blood of other living creatures. In addition, this magic has "
"an effect on the creature so that it becomes similar to an undead creature; "
"therefore necromancy, poison, and abilities that drain will have no effect "
"on a vampire. Some of the more powerful vampires even have the ability to "
"transform into bats. Due to all of this, vampires are often classified as a "
"different race.\n"
"\n"
"As vampires have a strong craving for blood, they usually overwhelm an "
"already existing society mainly composed of living creatures, and build a "
"monarchy or an oligarchy over it; the living members of the society would be "
"subservient to the local vampires, and annually, five dozen of those members "
"would be sacrificed to the vampire population. Due to this practice, the "
"vampiric overlords encourage the subservient population to reproduce in "
"great numbers so that the number of members of the subservient population "
"remains plentiful. In return for compliance, the participating families get "
"a somewhat higher place in society. These societies work for two reasons, "
"one because of the threat the vampires present; two, the subservient members "
"benefit from this setup.\n"
"\n"
"Since blood is a very important part of vampire society, it is used as their "
"currency. Also, blood is often involved in their magic."
