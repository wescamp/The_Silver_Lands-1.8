Fortunately for people of former times, nobody ever figured out how to open that portal, until now.\n"
"\n"
"Demons are nimble and quite tough creatures, who don't need armor or clothing to protect themselves from physical damage. Nevertheless, their appearance resembles that of a human. Most of them carry some kind of weapon, although their claws and ability to throw fireballs at their enemies usually fit better their purpose of seeking suffering and blood in their opponents."

"The Earth Monarch (or known to some by his personal name, Kaarakitros) is one of the divine incarnations of the elements; more specifically the incarnation of earth itself. Just like the other monarchs many ponder how he obtained his powers. Many do believe that all the monarchs used to be human, but as theory is confirmed there are many possibilities.\n"
"\n"
"Since Kaarakitros is the embodiment of earth itself, he is omnipotent with earth and things involving nature, such as wood, plants, etc. Kaarakitros wields a heavy club composed of highly compressed earth and other strong minerals, thus making it a very deadly weapon. Ostensibly, if Kaarakitros stays in an area for an extended amount of time, it will start teeming of life, an example of an area affected by this sublime ability is the Swamp of Life. Many underestimate Kaarakitros' abilities with earth and nature, this is a very idiotic assumption as he is capable of doing many things with the energy of nature like creating fire (but he does not have great control over the fire produced by his abilities since his elemental jurisdiction does not extend to fire). \n"
"\n"
"Kaarakitros is a very gentle person; it takes an immense amount of effort to get him angry. There is one thing that will get him angry easily though, and that is when someone deliberately destroys nature for a malicious or wasteful purpose. As with the other monarchs, Kaarakitros is known by many names. Examples include: the Noble Guardian of Nature, the Golem of Life, the Avatar of Nature and the Second Lord of Life. To those who hate or despise him, he is often referred to as the Spiteful Guardian, this refers the fact Kaarakitros often holds grudges on those who take delight in nature's destruction. When someone is terminally ill or if there is a stillborn baby, that person is often taken to the courtyard of the Earth Palace where there is a shrine. The person is place in front of the shrine and an offering is placed in the shrine, if the offering is accepted it glows green and it disappears into thin air (then it becomes a part of nature again) and the person is brought to full health. There are only rare occasions when the offering is refused, like when the person trying to be healed is an evil person."

"It is unknown how the Ice Maiden (or known to some by her personal name, Kimichira) gained her grand power; some believe that she was born with her powers, others believe that at some point in her life the power was transmitted into her body through a physical, yet inanimate artifact, and some believe that the Ice Maiden herself was created when the universe and the elements were born. Believers of the second theory believe that she used to be human before she gained her potency.\n"
"\n"
"Nonetheless, she is the incarnation of ice itself, thus she is omnipotent with ice, snow and similar substances. In addition, she is a master of gelid magic, thus she can turn water (something she cannot control) into ice and similar substances of which she can make use. She is also capable of flight, how she does this is unknown.\n"
"\n"
"Since the Ice Maiden is practically a goddess only an idiot would think she is able to be subdued. Nonetheless, many have tried to defeat her, all attempts to do so have miserably failed. The Ice Maiden is known by many names, as different races refer to her by different names.

"The Water Monarch (or known to some by his personal name, Shironsoato) is one of the divine incarnations of the elements; more specifically the incarnation of water itself. Just like the other monarchs many ponder how he obtained his powers. Many do believe that all the monarchs used to be human, but as theory is confirmed there are many possibilities.\n"
"\n"
"Since Shironsoato is the embodiment of water itself, he is omnipotent with water. In addition, he is a master of the naginata; therefore he prefers to use it in conjunction with his incredible power. Many think Shironsoato is powerless if there is not any water nearby; however, this is a foolish assumption since he can pull water out of many unexpected places such as the air, plants and other living creatures. Even though ice is a form of water, Shironsoato does not have direct power over ice as ultimate power over ice is held by the Ice Maiden; however, he is able to turn ice and similar substances into liquid form, but not vice-versa.\n"
"\n"
"Since Shironsoato lives in the Water Palace at the bottom of the Grand Mirror (called as such since its weather reflects Shironsoato's emotions), he is rarely involved in battle. Like the other monarchs he is known by many names, as different races refer to him differently. Examples include: the Noble Serpent, the Great Dragon of the Water, the Father of Water, and the First Lord of Life. To those who oppose and/or despise him he is often referred to as the Malevolent Dragon. Ostensibly, there is a shrine dedicated to the Water Monarch on the banks of the Grand Mirror; people put things in the shrine as an offering and will pray to the Water Monarch asking for rain in a certain area, etc. If the offering disappears that means the prayer will likely be answered; if the offering is blasted out of the shrine that means the prayer has been rejected."

msgid "The word 'elemental' is a term used to describe a magical creature that is purely composed of elemental energy. Apparently, the creation of an elemental involves the presence of powerful, arcane magic. Therefore, they are often found in an area influenced by an extremely powerful force. Albeit a somewhat rare situation, they are also found under the control of very powerful mages, those who are adept with the manipulation of aura and elemental energy. Although their behavior and characteristics differ due to the different elements of which they are composed, they generally have no personality (except for some of the more powerful elementals or those that were created in a manner that would grant them personality), and are protective of the force that created them. In addition, an elemental obviously has the powers, abilities, etc. associated with the element of which it is composed."

msgid "Vampires like to cast strange magic on stone statues, this results in a Gargoyle. Often the magic which is casted upon said statues results in the statue to float. Most gargoyles can only slam into their enemies to attack, so their masters, the Vampires often use them as blockades. Strangely the bizarre magic that grants a gargoyle its life reacts to blood in a way which causes the gargoyle to grow more powerful after absorbing enough blood."

msgid "The Chaos Hordes rely heavily in their lores' charisma to attrack more practicioners and recruit new adepts. Some of those adepts do not have the magic skills to join the Invoker orders, but instead are used as messengers of doom, given a club, a small supply of javelines and ridding them from their souls, via the darkest arts known only by the demonic masters. They are then sent to spread fear and despair amongst their victims, decimating their defenses before the demons are unleashed and sent to finish the job. Their fanatism leads them to forget any forms of proper defense, and so, being rather weak and vulnerable, kill their oponents even if that would mean their own death."

As demonic essence touches chaotic mages, they gain the sharpness of mind and way of thinking more resembling demons, than human beings. Trapped between humanity and demonity, they seek no turning back, but aspire to ultimately rid themselves of all mortal bounds, including their vulnerable souls. Yet, this mutation process has some important side effects on them, as they turn into demons; their resistance to arcane attacks is gradually reduced, to equal that of the true demons."

msgid "It is said that experience makes real warriors. Unfortunately, that is true even for the Chaos vanguard forces and their messengers, which usually are not warriors in the beginning. They don't even wield real weapons - except for a club and a few javelines to throw - in that stage of their training, in which many die or get converted into undead, or demons. But the bright ones who get to survive and gain experience become skilled enough to wield an axe. They are still far from mastering the use of battle axes, but that interim level is more than enough to cause trouble, death and destruction on the oponents of Chaos, which is why they are titled the 'Marauders' by survivors to their deadly assaults."

"The most dreadful part of the training of the messengers of doom is being rid of their souls by their masters. However, the resultant warrior is a mix of endurance, agility, accuracy and skill. Warriors that don't need armor, for they don't fear death at all, and prefer to wear just the necessary clothes and wield a minimal set of weaponry. Although they can be killed with ease by experienced and lucky oponents, the great damage that they can deal before dying is enough to compensate the loss for the Chaos hordes.\n"

"The rumors about Imps big as a tree have been, unfortunately, confirmed. Never seen before, the Imps of Armageddon are the masterminds of Chaos, and albeit usually hidden at safe distance from the battlefield, they sometimes decide to charge themselves against the unwary enemies, who are nothing but dirt compared to these gigantic beasts. That, and their unnatural strength and endurance, is why their are feared, not only by the opponents of the Chaos Empire, but also by lesser imps and most demons of the same band.\n"

"If you ever get to face one of these colossal brutes, escape as soon as possible from the battefield or be known to you that death is certain to arrive."

"It is not usual for an Imp to grow much above the size they had when born, nor to acquire intellect, in any sense. However, the unusual happens, and then it is possible for some of them to grow stronger and smarter in their attacks, to the point that they, instead of being cannon-fodder or suicidal attack force of demons, get to lead small groups of them, not having any armor or weapons other than their natural toughness and brute strength. As they delight in tearing their prey to pieces, they have been titled the 'Gutwrenchers' by those who have survived the horrendous event.\n"

"With time, they have developed a new dreadful attack weapon: acid slime, which can melt a human, or even orc, in matter of seconds. They spit it towards they victim, wait until it has consumed most of its body, and then finish the job swallowing the remaining flesh and bones. Worse than worse, they can now drain vital energy from their victims at close contact.\n"

msgid "These small metallic beasts seem not to need food or suchlike to live, very similar to undead. However, they cannot be such, since their resistance to fire, cold and arcane attacks is surprisingly high. Heavily armored, wielding a perilous steel mace and a rectangular shield, these 'automatons' are the new grunt attack and defense force of the evil forces that have taken over the known world. They somehow move rather quickly for their weight, a mystery that no one has been able yet to decipher. Their only drawback is their apparent lack of practice at moving in rough terrains such as hills and mountains."

Some have claimed to be capable of summoning forth fierce blizzards from a clear sky, an unlikely feat unconfirmed by outsiders. When asked about the mechanics of their abilities they often answer by refering to themselves as 'conduits'. Just what it is that they channel is never revealed.\n"

"There is an old tale about the creation of the the IceWind order: A gang of children were fishing when a very young female, hooking something bigger then she could land, was dragged into the subzero waters. She did not reappear. Two days later, by which time the tribe had nearly forgotton the loss, a sentry witnessed an unnerving spectacle. The very same girl, delirious with exhaustion and deathly pale, was spotted dragging herself from the pond.\n"
"\n"
"After the incident, the girl, whose name is a closely guarded secret, was never the same. The tribespeople told stories of seeing her freeze a bear solid, simply by looking at it, others claimed that she went out by night to converse with unseen things that moved in the water. Nobody dared approch her about these rumours, lest they prove to be true.\n"
"\n"
"She became the founder of the IceWind order, every year she would select children from the tribe to train. Whatever she taught them, it granted them a mysterious influence over the elements of their habitat. The Herders themselves describe this influence as 'union'. Within her lifetime the order became an accepted part of the clan.\n"
"\n"
"The child refused outright to reveal what had happened in the frozen pool and when she died many years later the secret died with her."

"The steppe chieftains are titled Khans, serving as both statesmen and generals. They have discovered the advantages of leading from behind, urging their fellows on before them. Before a battle it is customary for them to mingle with the soldiers, goading them on with threats, promises, insults or just primal bellows. Anything to spur them into a towering rage. Nearly everyone who has fought the orcs of the steppe has spoke of the unnerving roars of the orcish leaders.\n"

"\n"
"When the Outcasts first began performing supposedly forbidden magic on their own, the IceWind order raised an uproar in the tribal council. Under threat of exile the Outcasts were forced to ceace their activities. But their order survived, albeit in a different form. Rather then mimic their counterparts, they developed a parallel sect that exists on the fringes of the tribe. The magics worked by the Outcasts are undeniably crude, but have great practicle use.

Some so much so that the experience pushes their psyche, unstable and voilent at the best of times, dangerously close to the brink. Teetering on the fine edge between sanity and burning instinct, they are feared nearly as much by their comrades as by their enemies. Hurling themselves bodily into the fray, they attack enemies solely with their fists and teeth. Savages cease to use armour at all, allowing them greater speed and ease of movement but sacrificing the protection it gives. Few have been known to survive beyond early adulthood."

"Albeit with highly cutting-edge appearances, the Shaxthals are one of the most ancient inhabitants of this world. Supposedly, they were created by this world's original inhabitants by combining natural creatures with powerful technology and casting highly advance, arcane magic upon them. The reason for their creation was in order to aid their creators to protect themselves in the event of a series of assaults caused by creatures from another world. Although the Shaxthals succeeded with their purpose, they eventually turned against their creators due to a combination of their natural instincts and their adaptability. To make matters even worse, the adaptability mechanisms eventually allowed the Shaxthals to reproduce on their own. Their creators eventually found a way to destroy them, but they were too late. The strongest Shaxthals were simply sealed in pods, only to be reinvoked millenniums later by the Chaos Empire.\n"
"\n"
"Although Shaxthals are reprocessed creatures of all types, they all have glowing eyes, highly resilient metallic skin, and lack the need to breathe. Said skin is so resilient that it is quite hard to fell the creature; only powerful magic is an adequate force against such resilience. In addition, most Shaxthals have the ability to float at will. In addition to their fangs which transmit a powerful poison to the victim, and their claws, many Shaxthals have the ability to unleash an extremely powerful burst of energy at their quarry from their eyes.\n"
"\n"
"Nowadays, the Shaxthals have integrated themselves with the more natural ecosystem, with nobody commanding them. Despite this, the Shaxthals are still feared due to their immense power and their frightening reputation."

"Of all the horrors that have been witnessed by all those who oppose the Chaos Empire and survive the time necessary to pass the story onto generation by generation, the worst ever recorded might be these floating metallic beasts that resemble nagas in shape, and insects in appearance, that have big and strong claws, capable of cutting a man in half with small, if not nought, effort. These abominations, called the 'Shaxthal' by the witnesses, honor their name, derived from an ancient human dialect - which would mean 'invincible' in the modern tongue -, by being fierce, seemingly unstoppable and virtually invulnerable to physical weapons, for their body is protected by an incredibly tough and thick shell-armor, of which the only flaw would be the gaps of flesh in each joint, smelling like rotten flesh.\n"

"By their resemblance to insects, they have also been titled the 'Drones' by the rebel forces, but it is a name easily underestimated by unexperienced fighters that have never seen them in reality.

msgid "Beside the manufactured drones, other exotic lifeforms have developed and evolved amongst the Shaxthals, lifeforms that start from a mundane basis, such as birds. The shaxthal birds, however, are armored; this makes them slower than natural birds, but also makes them more dangerous, as they have the ability to throw some appendices of their armor that resemble feather-shaped knives, knives that can be shot from safe distance to the victim, inflicting great damage on it."

"The term 'vampire' is a word in an ancient dialect of the human language that would mean 'corrupted blood' in the modern tongue. In reality, vampires are not of a totally different race, but are the result of when a living creature's blood is corrupted by a very powerful, arcane type of magic. All vampires have red glowing eyes, white hair, pale skin, long fangs, and a craving for the blood of other living creatures. In addition, this magic has an effect on the creature so that it becomes similar to an undead creature; therefore necromancy, poison, and abilities that drain will have no effect on a vampire. Some of the more powerful vampires even have the ability to transform into bats. Due to all of this, vampires are often classified as a different race.\n"
"\n"
"As vampires have a strong craving for blood, they usually overwhelm an already existing society mainly composed of living creatures, and build a monarchy or an oligarchy over it; the living members of the society would be subservient to the local vampires, and annually, five dozen of those members would be sacrificed to the vampire population. Due to this practice, the vampiric overlords encourage the subservient population to reproduce in great numbers so that the number of members of the subservient population remains plentiful. In return for compliance, the participating families get a somewhat higher place in society. These societies work for two reasons, one because of the threat the vampires present; two, the subservient members benefit from this setup.\n"
"\n"
"Since blood is a very important part of vampire society, it is used as their currency. Also, blood is often involved in their magic."

msgid "Vampires always had a strong obsession with blood and control. As such, their magic typically involves blood, souls, and aura. These vampire mages attack their enemies by causing their blood to boil, or the mage will use their aura to disrupt their enemy's aura, thus being able to strike their soul. These mages' blood boiling magic works by causing the victim's aura to flare up, thus causing the victim's blood to boil. Since this magic works this way, it is able to damage the nonliving."

"Rarely seen, even by elves, a Wose is an order of creature about which little is known. The elves are the source of most of this knowledge; they know that these beings are not descended from trees, despite the similarity in form, and they know that a wose is more closely tied to the faerie world than the elves themselves, though in a different way. The motives and workings of their kind are unknown, though most posit the obvious idea that woses are wardens of the natural world.\n"
